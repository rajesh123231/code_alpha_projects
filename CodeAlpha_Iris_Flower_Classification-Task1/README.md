# About Author

Hi Everyone! Welcome to my notebook.

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm absolutely thrilled to welcome you into my world of data science exploration and innovation. My name's Affan Ansari , and I'm on a mission to uncover the secrets hidden within datasets. ðŸ“Š With a burning passion for data and a knack for machine learning, I'm here to dig deep, extract insights, and make a real impact.




## Overview
This dataset contains information about flowers with the following attributes:

Id: Unique identifier for each entry.

Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal in centimeters.  
Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal in centimeters.  
Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal in centimeters.  
Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal in centimeters.  
Species: The species of the flower

The Iris flower classification dataset comprises a total of 150 samples of Iris flowers, which are divided into three distinct species:

Iris setosa  
Iris versicolor    
Iris virginica  
 
This dataset is organized into three classes, each containing 50 instances, representing different types of Iris plants. Notably, one of these classes can be separated from the other two using a linear boundary, whereas the remaining two classes are not linearly separable from each other.
